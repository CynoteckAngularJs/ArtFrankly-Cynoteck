    The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof) or the Services
    shall be <strong>BINDING ARBITRATION</strong> administered by the American Arbitration Association in the State of New York. The one exception to the
    exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim which does not exceed Five Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars against Art
    Frankly in small-claims court in New York County. But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or
    maintain against Art Frankly any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.

    agreement. In doing so, <strong>YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO: </strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">
    <strong> (i) BRING AN ACTION IN AND GO TO COURT</strong>
    to assert or defend any claims between you and Art Frankly (except for matters which are equal to or less than Five Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars which must

    <strong> (iii) </strong>
    <strong>HAVE YOUR CLAIM(S), OR CLAIMS AGAINST YOU, BE DECIDED BY A </strong>
    <strong>JUDGE OR JURY.</strong>
    You are entitled to a fair hearing before a neutral third party arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that
    arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in
    court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.

    for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against Art Frankly (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or
    state courts located in New York County, New York. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.
